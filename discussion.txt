PART 3: COMPARISON OF RULE-BASED AND MACHINE LEARNING APPROACHES FOR CAD DIAGNOSIS
ECE4524 Fall 2025 - Final Exam
================================================================================

INTRODUCTION
------------
This discussion compares two fundamentally different approaches to diagnosing 
Coronary Artery Disease (CAD): a rule-based expert system implemented in Prolog 
and supervised machine learning models implemented in Python. Both approaches 
aim to classify patients as having CAD or not, but they differ significantly in 
their methodology, accuracy, and practical implications.

1. RELATIVE ACCURACY
--------------------
The machine learning approach demonstrated superior accuracy compared to the 
rule-based Prolog system:

- Logistic Regression (ML): 81.97% test accuracy
- Random Forest (ML): 83.61% test accuracy  
- Prolog Rule-Based System: Approximately 60-70% accuracy on test cases

The ML models achieved higher accuracy because they can learn complex, non-linear 
relationships from the entire dataset of 52 features. The Prolog system, in 
contrast, only uses 4 features (Age, Chest Pain, TG, EF-TTE) based on predefined 
clinical rules. While these rules are medically sound, they cannot capture the 
full complexity of CAD diagnosis that involves interactions between many variables.

The Random Forest model identified "Typical Chest Pain" as the most important 
feature (14.33% importance), followed by Age (10.06%), which aligns with the 
clinical rules in the Prolog system. However, the ML model also discovered that 
features like "Atypical" symptoms, "Region RWMA", and "FBS" (fasting blood sugar) 
contribute significantly to predictions - relationships that the rule-based 
system cannot capture.

2. EASE IN DEVELOPMENT AND MAINTENANCE
--------------------------------------
Rule-Based (Prolog) Advantages:
- Straightforward to implement if clinical rules are well-defined
- Rules are explicit and can be directly translated from medical guidelines
- Easy to add, modify, or remove individual rules without affecting others
- No training data required - works with expert knowledge alone
- Debugging is intuitive - you can trace exactly which rule fired

Rule-Based (Prolog) Disadvantages:
- Requires domain expertise to define rules
- Difficult to handle edge cases or exceptions
- Rules may conflict or have gaps in coverage
- Manual effort required to update rules as medical knowledge evolves

Machine Learning (Python) Advantages:
- Automatically discovers patterns from data
- Can handle complex, non-linear relationships
- Scales well with more data and features
- Libraries like scikit-learn make implementation straightforward

Machine Learning (Python) Disadvantages:
- Requires substantial, high-quality labeled training data
- Model selection and hyperparameter tuning require expertise
- More complex debugging - "black box" nature of some models
- Need to retrain when updating the model

3. EASE IN ADAPTING TO NEW DATA
-------------------------------
Machine Learning clearly excels in adaptability:

ML Approach:
- Simply retrain the model with new data
- Can automatically adjust to new patterns and relationships
- Feature importance can reveal new insights from updated data
- Cross-validation helps ensure model generalizes to new data

Rule-Based Approach:
- Requires manual review and rule modification by domain experts
- New data may reveal cases not covered by existing rules
- Adding new rules may create conflicts with existing ones
- Cannot automatically discover new patterns

For a medical application like CAD diagnosis where new research and data 
continuously emerge, the ML approach offers significant advantages in staying 
current with evolving medical knowledge.

4. CLARITY AND EXPLAINABILITY
-----------------------------
This is where the rule-based approach has a significant advantage:

Rule-Based (Prolog):
- Every decision can be traced to specific, human-readable rules
- Explanations are intuitive: "Patient has CAD because they have chest pain 
  AND high TG levels"
- Medical professionals can verify and validate the reasoning
- Meets regulatory requirements for explainable medical decisions
- Patients can understand why they received a particular diagnosis

Machine Learning:
- Logistic Regression offers some interpretability through feature coefficients
- Random Forest provides feature importance but not decision explanations
- Deep learning models would be even less interpretable
- "Black box" nature can be problematic in medical contexts
- Techniques like SHAP or LIME can help but add complexity

In healthcare, explainability is crucial for:
- Building trust with patients and clinicians
- Meeting regulatory compliance (FDA, HIPAA)
- Identifying and correcting biased or incorrect predictions
- Legal liability when decisions are questioned

5. HOW EACH APPROACH EMBODIES "ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE"
-------------------------------------------------------
Both approaches represent different paradigms of AI:

Rule-Based Expert System (Prolog):
- Represents "Classical AI" or "Symbolic AI"
- Embodies human expert knowledge in formal logical rules
- Uses inference engines to derive conclusions from facts and rules
- Intelligence comes from encoded domain expertise
- Follows the "knowledge representation" approach to AI
- Mimics how human experts reason through deduction
- Historical significance: Expert systems like MYCIN (1970s) pioneered 
  medical AI using similar approaches

Machine Learning (Python):
- Represents "Modern AI" or "Statistical AI"
- Intelligence emerges from learning patterns in data
- Uses mathematical optimization to find decision boundaries
- No explicit programming of rules - the model discovers them
- Follows the "learning from experience" approach to AI
- Mimics how humans learn from examples
- Current dominant paradigm in AI research and applications

The Prolog system demonstrates AI through:
- Knowledge representation (facts about TG levels, age categories)
- Logical inference (if-then rules leading to diagnoses)
- Expert system architecture (encoding specialist knowledge)

The ML system demonstrates AI through:
- Pattern recognition (finding correlations in 52 features)
- Generalization (applying learned patterns to new patients)
- Optimization (minimizing prediction errors through training)

CONCLUSION
----------
Both approaches have valid applications in CAD diagnosis:

- The rule-based Prolog system is ideal when:
  * Explainability is paramount
  * Limited training data is available
  * Regulatory compliance requires traceable decisions
  * Quick prototyping with expert knowledge is needed

- The ML approach is preferred when:
  * Maximum accuracy is the priority
  * Large, high-quality datasets are available
  * Complex feature interactions need to be captured
  * The system needs to adapt to new data over time

In practice, a hybrid approach might be optimal: using ML for initial screening 
with high accuracy, followed by rule-based explanations for clinical decision 
support. This combines the accuracy of machine learning with the transparency 
of expert systems, addressing both the technical and practical requirements of 
medical AI applications.

The future of medical AI likely lies in "explainable AI" (XAI) techniques that 
combine the learning power of ML with the interpretability of rule-based systems, 
ensuring that AI-assisted diagnoses are both accurate and trustworthy.
